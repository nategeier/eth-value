His previous role at a FinTech startup called Bumped is what pushed him over the edge to start focusing full time on blockchain. He worked with clearing firms specifically that managed customers stock positions, AML, and KYC processes. The application was a platform that automatically gave users fractional shares of any publicly traded company as a reward from the users daily spending occurrences pulled from Plaid. Ex: Users buys a coffee at Starbucks, the user gets 0.0021 SBUX.'
